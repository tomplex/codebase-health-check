Invoke the codebase-health-check:codebase-health-check skill and follow it exactly as presented to you.

The user's arguments to this command are: ${ARGUMENTS}

If arguments were provided, use them as the scope (the directory or file to analyze). If no arguments were provided (empty string), the skill will determine the scope by asking the user.
